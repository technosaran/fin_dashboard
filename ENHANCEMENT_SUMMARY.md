## 7. Automated Ledger Integration 📝

### Problem Statement
Previously, ledger entries for investment transactions (Stocks, FNO, and Mutual Funds) were only created when users explicitly selected an account. This required manual action for each transaction, which was inconvenient and could lead to missing ledger entries.

### Solution Implemented
Modified the database trigger `sync_investment_to_ledger()` to automatically create ledger entries for ALL investment transactions, regardless of whether an account is selected.

**Key Changes:**
- **Database Migration**: Created `20260205201000_auto_ledger_entries.sql`
- **Automatic Logging**: Removed the `IF NEW.account_id IS NOT NULL` condition
- **Backward Compatible**: Account linking remains optional
- **Balance Safety**: Account balances only update when an account is explicitly linked

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **No Manual Action Required**: Ledger entries automatically created for all transactions
- ✅ **Complete Audit Trail**: Every buy/sell/exit transaction is logged
- ✅ **Flexible Accounting**: Users can still link accounts for balance tracking
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Same automatic logging for Stocks, FNO, and Mutual Funds

**Technical Details:**
- Ledger entries always created with category 'Investments'
- For Stocks: Includes brokerage and tax charges in amount
- For FNO: Separate entries for entry (expense) and exit (income)
- For Mutual Funds: BUY/SIP as expense, SELL as income
- account_id is nullable, allowing ledger-only entries

**Transaction Types Covered:**
1. **Stock Transactions**: BUY → Expense, SELL → Income
2. **FNO Trades**: Entry → Expense, Exit → Income (includes P&L)
3. **Mutual Fund Transactions**: BUY/SIP → Expense, SELL → Income
